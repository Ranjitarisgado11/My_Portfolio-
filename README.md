   The Titanic dataset provides an excellent opportunity to practice data analysis techniques, including loading, cleaning, and visualization. This activity walks through essential steps like importing libraries, understanding dataset structure, and addressing missing values. Notable observations include survival trends: younger passengers, especially children, had higher chances of survival. Leveraging tools such as `pandas` and `matplotlib`, this activity highlights the value of systematic data preparation and visualization in extracting meaningful insights from real-world data.

      In this laboratory activity, the Titanic dataset is cleaned and analyzed to uncover patterns. Steps include handling missing values by imputing ages with the median and removing unnecessary columns such as `Cabin`. Duplicate records are eliminated, and categorical data types are standardized for efficiency. Key discoveries reveal that women and passengers in higher classes had greater survival probabilities, as shown through bar plots. Additional analyses on survival counts and age distribution highlight that most passengers aged 20–40 did not survive, emphasizing demographic influences on survival outcomes.

     Symbolic computation takes center stage in this activity, where SymPy is used to simplify, expand, and manipulate mathematical expressions. Users begin with basic arithmetic and symbolic equations, progressing to tasks such as simplifying complex expressions or expanding polynomials. The intuitive syntax of SymPy allows users to explore concepts like `2x + 3y = 12` symbolically, preparing them for more advanced algebraic or computational applications. This activity underscores the elegance and efficiency of symbolic calculations in Python.
